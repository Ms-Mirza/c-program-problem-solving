// when function is calling itself, it is called recursion.
// Recursion is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
// A recursive function is a function that calls itself in order to solve a problem.
// for recursion to work, we need a base case and a recursive case.
